# SkyRizz E32 module-by-module firmware map

This version is module-centric instead of ESP32-pin-centric. Each onboard IC, flex connector, LED chain, and external connector is listed pin-by-pin so you can see exactly how firmware reaches it: directly from an ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 GPIO, through the shared buses, or through the XL9535 I/O expander.

## Quick board-level firmware view

- Only `C_P0` is a direct external ESP32 GPIO (`GPIO1`). External `P1`-`P7` come from the XL9535, so they are slower I2C-backed GPIOs rather than native ESP32 pins.
- `GPIO47` / `GPIO48` are the main shared I2C bus for nearly every sensor / control IC on the board.
- `GPIO43 / U0TXD` is consumed by the XL9535 interrupt line `BUS_INT`.
- `GPIO44 / U0RXD` is reused as SPI clock `SCLK3` for both the TF socket and `U2`.
- `GPIO0` is both the ESP32 boot-strap pin and the shared audio `BCLK` line. Treat it carefully at boot.
- `GPIO35`, `GPIO36`, and `GPIO37` are unused in this PCB netlist.
- The XL9535 also owns the local user LED plus the local switches / buttons `SW1`, `SW2`, `SW3`, `PB1`, and `PB2`; those are not native ESP32 GPIOs.

Camera-specific notes: `FPC3 pad 17` is not a usable GPIO signal — it is strapped to ground through `R32`. `FPC3 pads 14/21` are `2V8`, and `pad 15` is `1V8` for the attached camera module.

| `1` | `1` | `P9` | XL9535 `P04` via I2C (`GPIO47`/`GPIO48`), IRQ on `GPIO43` | Signal side of the switch. |
| `2` | `2` | `P9` | XL9535 `P04` via I2C (`GPIO47`/`GPIO48`), IRQ on `GPIO43` | Same switched signal as pad `1`. |

### `PB1` — Local push button 1

Firmware access: XL9535 `P05` on net `P10`. `R7` pulls the line up to `3V3`, and `C21` forms the local RC network to ground.

| `4` | `4` | `GND` | Ground | Grounded pad on the tactile switch body. |

### `SW3` — Local switch 3

Firmware access: XL9535 `P11` on net `P7`; the switch shorts `P7` to ground. `R39` pulls the line up to `3V3`, and this same net is also broken out as external `IO 3` / `C_P4-7 pad 6`.

| Pad | Signal / pin label | Net | ESP32 / firmware path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `1` | `1` | `P7` | XL9535 `P11` via I2C (`GPIO47`/`GPIO48`), IRQ on `GPIO43` | Signal side of the switch; shared with the external `P7` header pin. |
| `2` | `2` | `P7` | XL9535 `P11` via I2C (`GPIO47`/`GPIO48`), IRQ on `GPIO43` | Same switched signal as pad `1`. |
| `3` | `3` | `GND` | Ground | Ground side of the switch. |
| `4` | `4` | `GND` | Ground | Ground side of the switch. |

## Storage and SPI devices

### `TF1` — TF / microSD socket

| `13` | `GND` | `GND` | Ground | Ground. |

### `U2` — GT30L24A3W SPI ROM / font chip

Firmware access: Shares SPI with the TF socket. `CS#` is inverted from `GPIO40 / CS3` through `Q5`.

| Pad | Signal / pin label | Net | ESP32 / firmware path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `1` | `CS#` | `$1N44298` | U2 CS# from GPIO40 / CS3 through R28/Q5 inverter | Chip select is inverted from `GPIO40 / CS3` by `Q5`. |
| `2` | `SO` | `MISO3` | GPIO41 | Shared SPI `MISO` on `GPIO41`. |
| `3` | `NC` | `` | Not connected | Not connected. |
| `4` | `GND` | `GND` | Ground | Ground. |
| `5` | `SI` | `MOSI3` | GPIO42 | Shared SPI `MOSI` on `GPIO42`. |
| `6` | `SCLK` | `SCLK3` | GPIO44 / U0RXD | Shared SPI clock on `GPIO44 / U0RXD`. |
| `7` | `HOLD#` | `$1N44462` | Pull-up only (R31 -> 3V3) | `HOLD#` pulled high by `R31`. |
| `8` | `VCC` | `3V3` | 3V3 rail | 3.3 V supply rail. Not a GPIO. |

Important `U2` quirk: the GT30 chip is selected when `GPIO40 / CS3` is **high**, because `Q5` inverts the signal. The TF card sees the normal active-low `CS3` directly.

## I/O expansion

### `U9` — XL9535 I/O expander

Firmware access: I2C I/O expander on the shared bus; `INT#` returns to `GPIO43 / U0TXD`; address pins are grounded so the address is `0x20`.

### `USB1` — USB Type-C connector

Firmware access: Native USB FS D+/D- go to `GPIO20`/`GPIO19` through `U3`; CC pins are passive 5.1k pulldowns; VBUS is power only.
