# SkyRizz E32 ESP32-S3 module pin capabilities

- Module symbol / part: `ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N16R8`
- Generated to help build a visual pinout diagram in the style of common ESP32 reference images.
- Complementary board wiring reference: `pin_map.md`

This file answers two different questions for every module pin:

1. What the ESP32-S3 silicon can do on that pin (`RTC`, `ADC`, `TOUCH`, `USB`, `UART`, `JTAG`, strapping).
2. What the SkyRizz E32 PCB already uses that pin for.

## Quick takeaways

- Public module pins in the EasyEDA symbol: `41` total, including power and ground pins.
- The board-silk external headers are **`IO 1` = `C_P0`**, **`I2C` = `C_I2C`**, **`IO 2` = `C_P1-3`**, and **`IO 3` = `C_P4-7`**.
- The only intentionally direct external native ESP32 GPIO on this PCB is **`IO 1` / module pin 39 / GPIO1 / net `P0`**.
- The main shared buses are **module pins 24-25 (`GPIO47/48`)** for I2C and **module pins 33-36 (`GPIO40/41/42/44`)** for SPI.
- The shared I2C + XL9535 path also owns the local controls: **`IND` user LED**, **`SW1`**, **`SW2`**, **`PB1`**, **`PB2`**, and **`SW3`**.
- Native USB is hard-wired on **module pins 13-14 (`GPIO19/20`)** to the USB-C connector.
- Module pins **28-30 (`GPIO35/36/37`)** have no board trace in this PCB netlist, so they are not broken out to any connector or onboard device.
- `GPIO0`, `GPIO3`, `GPIO45`, and `GPIO46` are strapping pins and are also used by onboard peripherals here, so treat them carefully at boot.
- `GPIO39-42` can be external JTAG pins if you switch JTAG away from USB Serial/JTAG, but this board already uses them for audio / SPI.

## Best pins to think about first in firmware

- **Direct external native GPIO:** module pin `39` / `GPIO1` / net `P0`.
- **Shared I2C bus:** module pins `24-25` / `GPIO47-48`.
- **Board-silk external headers:** `IO 1`, `I2C`, `IO 2`, `IO 3`.
- **Local XL9535 controls:** `IND`, `SW1`, `SW2`, `PB1`, `PB2`, `SW3`.
- **Shared SPI bus:** module pins `33-36` / `GPIO40/41/42/44`.
- **Touch interrupt:** module pin `38` / `GPIO2`.
- **USB:** module pins `13-14` / `GPIO19-20`.
- **Unrouted in this PCB:** module pins `28-30` / `GPIO35-37`.

| RGB indicator | `RGB1` | First WS2812-style RGB LED | `GPIO46` serial LED data |
| RGB indicator | `RGB2` | Second WS2812-style RGB LED | Chained from `RGB1 DOUT` |
| User indicator | `IND` | User / indicator LED | XL9535 `P17` via shared I2C |
| Local control | `SW1` | Local switch 1 | XL9535 `P12` / net `P8` |
| Local control | `SW2` | Local switch 2 | XL9535 `P04` / net `P9` |
| Local control | `PB1` | Local push button 1 | XL9535 `P05` / net `P10` |
| Local control | `PB2` | Local push button 2 | XL9535 `P06` / net `P11` |
| Local control | `SW3` | Local switch 3 | XL9535 `P11` / net `P7`, shared with external `IO 3` |

| SPI device | `U2` | GT30L24A3W SPI ROM / font chip | Shared SPI on `GPIO40/41/42/44`, inverted chip-select |
| Secure element | `U18` | SE050 secure element | Shared I2C on `GPIO47` / `GPIO48` + XL9535 reset |
| I/O expander | `U9` | XL9535 16-bit GPIO expander | Shared I2C on `GPIO47` / `GPIO48`, interrupt on `GPIO43` |
| External header | `C_P0` / `IO 1` | Direct external GPIO header | Native `GPIO1` (`P0`) + power/ground |
| External header | `C_I2C` / `I2C` | External I2C header | Direct breakout of `GPIO47` / `GPIO48` |
| External header | `C_P1-3` / `IO 2` | External expander GPIO header | XL9535-backed `P1` / `P2` / `P3` |
| External header | `C_P4-7` / `IO 3` | External expander GPIO header | XL9535-backed `P4` / `P5` / `P6` / `P7` |
| USB interface | `USB1` | USB Type-C connector | Native USB on `GPIO19` / `GPIO20` |

Practical firmware note: the board has only one intentionally direct external native ESP32 GPIO (`GPIO1` on `IO 1`). Most extra board controls and expansion pins are on the shared I2C + XL9535 path.
